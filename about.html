                        <p>We identified that many business had websites with inconsistent stationery design, which failed to
                            represent their business. Often these came about through well meaning family and friends who
                            tried to help but often disadvantaged the person or business they were trying to help. Starting
                            from a small base we began offering a friendly, but professional service to the contacts we had
                            available to us mirroring the desire to help but providing a service that delivered.</p>
                        <p>We now occupy offices in Southend and have grown to a team of 6 with expertise not just in website
                            and design, but in the in the many associated services that we offer. This allows us to stay
                            up to date with the rapidly changing techniques and advances in the individual fields. Our goal
                            is to provide you with one company that knows what you are about and is able to provide an outstanding
                            service with consistent delivery for all your media and creative needs.</p>
